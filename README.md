# DowseJanitor

Automatically dowses, if enabled moves your character and logs the dowsing results (what was found and where) to text files. Can be run passively whilst you travel about doing other things / chatting, just as long as you go to the main window and scroll through all the dowses it has done every so often!

## Installation

- Extract at C:\Games\Automato\games\atitd. Make sure the dowse.png is in the images folder and the dowse_janitor.lua is in the scripts.

## Setup

- Enable Options -> Interface Options -> Movement -> Use arrow keys for movement.
- Enable Options -> Chat Options -> Main Chat -> Minimized chat-channels are still visible.

## Using the macro

- Point your character in the direction you want it to move. 
- Have chat minimized but with the main tab and contents visibile. The macro will save any dowses it sees in the chat area, so you can switch away from main, switch back later and scroll through the contents to save all the dowse data not previously seen. 
- All data will be saved in C:\Games\Automato\games\atitd\dowse_csv.txt! 

Happy dowsing!
